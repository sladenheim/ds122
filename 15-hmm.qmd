## HMMs in Real Life
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
**Hidden Markov Models** (HMMs) deal with Markov processes in which the states are unobservable or _**hidden**_ but influence an _**observable**_ process.

HMMs are used in various fields that include bioinformatics, finance, robotics, developmental studies, speech recognition, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## HMMs in Real Life
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}


- A concrete example from a developmental study is modelling of infant-free-play regimes. While it is not possible to directly observe if an infant is focused or exploring, a prediction can be made based on the number of toys they were interacting during a certain period of time.

## HMMs in Real Life
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}

- One of the applications of HMMs in computational finance is for modeling stock market states, such as a bull market (it occurs when the stock prices are rising and investors are optimistic) and a bear market (it happends when the prices decline). It is impossible to directly observe the state of the market but put/call ratios, which are indicators of investor sentiment and are associated with short-term stock market returns, can be used to predict them.

## HMMs in Real Life
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}

- In NLP, HMMs are often used for Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging, a process that assigns a grammatical category, such as noun, verb, and adjective, to each word in a piece of text. While this task seems relatively easy to humans who speak the language from which the text has been taken, it is much harder for a machine. For instance, consider the following sentences:

* I should book my flight to Paris.
* I am reading an interesting book.

The word book is a verb in the first sentence and is a noun in the second one. There are many ambigous words, like book, for which the POS-tagging is not a trivial task.
We will look into HMMs for POS tagging in more detail in the next lecture.

## Umbrella Problem
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
:::{.columns}

:::{.center-text}
<img src="images/hmm/umbrella.png" width=300/>
:::
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
A student is studying for an exam in a room without any windows. Every day she wants to know whether it is rainy or sunny outside. However, her only access to the outside world is when she sees her housemate leaving the house with or without an umbrella each morning. 
:::
:::

__Question__: Given the housemate’s behavior:

- Day 1: no umbrella
- Day 2: umbrella
- Day 3: umbrella
- Day 4: no umbrella

What can the student infer about the weather on each of those days?
:::

## Umbrella Problem
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
This problem is a little unrealistic but has the components we are interested in.

- The student doesn't have direct access to the outside world, but wants to know whether it is sunny or rainy. Therefore, the set $\left\{\text{Sunny}, \text{Rainy} \right\}$ represents the hidden states.  

- Instead of observing the hidden states directly, the student observes a signal emitted by the hidden states - whether the housemate carries an umbrella or not. Thus, $\left\{\text{No umbrella}, \text{Umbrella}\right\}$ is the set of possible observations.

- The signal that the student observes is noisy. For example, even if it's not raining, the housemate might be bringing an umbrella, because he forgot to check the weather report.
:::

## Model Assumptions
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
To model the umbrella problem, we need to represent it as a discrete-time process. That is, we need to specify a time step between the events.
```{python}
from IPython.core.display import HTML

def generate_html():
    return r"""
    <div class="blue-box">
        <p>
    What is a good time step in this case?
        </p>
    </div>
    """
html_content = generate_html()
display(HTML(html_content))
```

Furthermore, we need the following assumptions to create an HMM.

1. _**Markov property**_: the weather at day $n+1$ depends only on the weather at day $n$. 
2. _**Stationarity**_: the probability of transitioning from one hidden state to another is the same for every time step.
3. _**Output independence**_: the observation at day $n+1$ depends only on the hidden state at day $n+1$.

:::

## State-Transition Diagram
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}

Let us visualize the model and assign the probabilities.

:::{.center-text}
<img src="images/hmm/HMM_diagram_no_start.svg" width=900/>
:::

The diagram shows that, for instance, the probability of the housemate brining an umbrella on a sunny day is 0.2. <br>
In addition, we assume that the _**intial probabilities are 0.6 and 0.4 for a sunny day and a rainy day**_, respectively.

:::

## Decoding
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
In general, there are three types of questions that can be asked about the HMMs.

1. **Evaluation**: What is the probability of an observed sequence?
2. __Decoding__: What is the most likely series of hidden states to generate an observed sequence?
3. __Learning__: How can we learn the parameters of HMM given some data?

We will focus on decoding problems.
In particular, the question we are going to address in this and next lecture is the following:<br>
Given the model depicted in the state-transition diagram and a sequence of observations $O=\left(o_0,o_1,o_2,o_3\right)=(0,1,1,0)$. Find the sequence of hidden states $X=\left(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3\right)$ that best describes the observations $O$.
:::

## Transition Matrix
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
The state-transition diagram provides an accesible manner to present the HMM for the umbrella problem. However, this is only the case for problems with a low number of hidden and observable states. Generally, matrix notation is used to describe the model.

```{python}
from IPython.core.display import HTML

def generate_html():
    return r"""
    <div class="purple-box">
     <span class="label"> Transition Matrix </span>
        <p>
        For \(\small N\) hidden states, \(\small Q=\left\{q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{N}\right\}\), the transition matrix \(\small A\) is an \(\small N\times N\) matrix with transition probabilities equal to

        $$\small A_{ij} = P\left(\text{state } q_i \text{ at time } n+1 \:| \text{ state } q_j \text{ at time } n \right).$$
        </p>
    </div>
    """
html_content = generate_html()
display(HTML(html_content))
```
__Remark__: A transition matrix is column stochastic: each of its columns sums up to 1.
:::

## Transition Probabilities
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
__Example__: The transition matrix for the umbrella problem is equal to

$$\small A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.7 & 0.4 \\
0.3 & 0.6
\end{bmatrix}.$$
<br>


The __initial transition probabilities__ are typically stored in vector $\pi.$

__Example__: For the umbrella problem, the initial probabilities are given by 

$$ \small \pi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\ 0.4 \end{bmatrix}.$$
:::

## Emission Matrix
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
```{python}
from IPython.core.display import HTML

def generate_html():
    return r"""
    <div class="purple-box">
     <span class="label"> Emission Matrix </span>
        <p>
        For a general set of possible observations \(\small V = \left\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{M} \right\},\) the emission matrix \(\small B\) is an \(\small M\times N\) matrix with observation probabilities equal to

        $$\small B_{ij} = P\left( \text{observation } v_i \text{ at time } n \: | \text{ state } q_j \text{ at time } n \right).$$
        </p>
    </div>
    """
html_content = generate_html()
display(HTML(html_content))
```

__Remark__: $\small B$ is column stochastic.<br>
__Remark__: Together $\small A, B,$ and $\small \pi$ fully define an HMM.

__Example__: For the umbrella example $\small B$ becomes

$$\small B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.8 & 0.4\\
0.2 & 0.6
\end{bmatrix}.$$
:::

## Brute-Force Approach
:::{style="font-size: .75em"}
Recall that we want to decode the following sequence of observations $\small{O=(0,1,1,0).}$<br> 
It is possible to answer this question by directly computing the joint probability of $\small O$ with each sequence of hidden states of length 4. This strategy is called the _brute-force_ approach. <br>
Let's find an expression for the joint probability for a general sequence of observations of length 4, $\small{O=(o_0,o_1,o_2,o_3)}$, and a corresponding sequence of hidden states, $\small{X = (x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3).}$ 

$$\small{P(O,X) = P(o_0, o_1, o_2, o_3, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)}$$ 
$$\small{= P(o_3|o_0, o_1, o_2, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)P(o_0, o_1, o_2, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)}$$

$$\small{ = P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_0, o_1, o_2, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)}$$ 
$$\small{= P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_2 | o_0, o_1, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)P(o_0, o_1, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)}$$
:::

## Brute-Force Approach
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
$$ \small{= P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_2 | x_2)P(o_0, o_1, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = \dots }$$ 
$$ \small{= P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_2 | x_2)P(o_1 | x_1)P(o_0 | x_0)P(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)}$$
$$\small{= P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_2 | x_2)P(o_1 | x_1)P(o_0 | x_0)P(x_3 | x_0, x_1, x_2) P(x_0, x_1, x_2)}$$
$$\small{= P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_2 | x_2)P(o_1 | x_1)P(o_0 | x_0)P(x_3 | x_2) P(x_0, x_1, x_2)= \dots}$$
$$ \small  = P(o_3 | x_3)P(o_2 | x_2)P(o_1 | x_1)P(o_0 | x_0)P(x_3 | x_2) P(x_2 | x_1) P(x_1 | x_0)P(x_0).$$ 

This can be written as 

$$\small{P(O,X) = \prod_{n=0}^3 P(o_n | x_n) \prod_{n=1}^3 P(x_n | x_{n-1})P(x_0).}$$ 

<!-- All we did to obtain this expression was using conditional probability, the output-independence assumption, and the Markov-property assumption. -->
:::

## Brute-Force Approach
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
Similarly, for $\small O$ and $\small X$ of length $\small T$, the expression becomes

$$\small{P(O,X) = \prod_{n=0}^{T-1} P(o_n | x_n) \prod_{n=1}^{T-1} P(x_n | x_{n-1})P(x_0).}$$

__Example__: Let us look at the joint probability of observation sequence $\small{(0,1,1,0)}$ and hidden-state sequence $\small{(S,R,S,S)}$:

$$\small{P(0,1,1,0,S,R,S,S) = P(0|S)P(1|S)P(1|R)P(0|S)P(S|S)P(S|R)P(R|S)P(S)}$$
$$\small{ = B_{11}B_{21}B_{22}B_{11}A_{11}A_{12}A_{21}\pi_1}$$
$$\small{ =0.8\cdot0.2\cdot0.6\cdot0.8\cdot0.7\cdot0.4\cdot0.3\cdot0.6\approx0.00387.}$$
:::

## Brute-Force Approach
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
```{python}
from IPython.core.display import HTML

def generate_html():
    return r"""
    <div class="blue-box">
        <p>
    What is the total number of joint probabilities needed to compute for the umbrella problem using the brute-force approach?
        </p>
    </div>
    """
html_content = generate_html()
display(HTML(html_content))
```


Imagine a problem with $\small N=10$ hidden states and an observation sequence of length $\small T=100$. We would have to compute $\small 10^{100}$ joint probabilities! <br>
<br>

In general, the brute-force approach is infeasible. <br>
<br>
