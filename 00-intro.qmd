## Words of Wisdom
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
Advice from former students:

- _Go to the lectures and ask questions._
- _This class moves fast and this class builds on every little thing from the previous lecture. It is CRUCIAL that you understand the very basics like distributions, random variables, and probability._
- _Study the lecture slides carefully and set aside time outside of class to fully understand them, THEN do the homework. This way,
the content will feel more relevant to you, and you'll depend less on AI to find the solution. Attempt the group question even if you
don't know what's going on._
- _Take the time to practice the problems and learn the content. There's a lot of content and it's hard to learn all of it at once._
<!-- - _I would tell them to go to lecture and set time aside to review the lectures._ -->
<!-- - _Pay attention during the discussions._ -->

Advice: come to lectures, participate, go to discussions, think deeply about the homework questions

Group questions: on the last slides. Practice in class or after!

:::{.notes}
Both perspectives are valid and both have their pros and cons.

Frequentist: more objective and interpretive

Bayesian: more intuitive and allows to use prior knowledge BUT can be contaversial!

## Why Is Probability Important?

_Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write!_ <br>

Samuel S. Wilks (1906 - 1964)

Imagine you receive an email from a stockbroker predicting that a certain stock will go up next week. It does. 

The next week, you get another email from the same broker. Another correct prediction. This continues for several weeks. Each prediction spot-on.

from IPython.core.display import HTML

def generate_html():
    return r"""
    <div class="blue-box">
        <p>
    Would you consider investing based on their next tip?
