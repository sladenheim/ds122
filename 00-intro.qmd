## Words of Wisdom
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
Advice from former students:

- _Go to the lectures and ask questions._
- _This class moves fast and this class builds on every little thing from the previous lecture. It is CRUCIAL that you understand the very basics like distributions, random variables, and probability._
- _I would tell them to go to lecture and set time aside to review the lectures._
- _Take the time to practice the problems and learn the content. There's a lot of content and it's hard to learn all of it at once._
- _practice! probability is hard…. and recognizing questions and what they are asking needs practice_
- _Pay attention during the discussions._

Advice: come to lectures, participate, go to discussions, think deeply about the homework questions

- __Frequentist view__: Probability is the proportion of times an outcome occurs when a situation is repeated many times under the same conditions.
<!-- __Examples__: Flipping a coin and counting heads.<br>
Rolling a die and observing the number of points. -->

:::{.notes}
Both perspectives are valid and both have their pros and cons.

Frequentist: more objective and interpretive

Bayesian: more intuitive and allows to use prior knowledge BUT can be contaversial!

## Why Is Probability Important?
:::{style="font-size: .8em"}
_Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write!_ <br>

Samuel S. Wilks (1906 - 1964)

Imagine you receive a letter from a stockbroker predicting that a certain stock will go up next week. It does. 

The next week, you get another letter from the same broker. Another correct prediction. This continues for several weeks. Each prediction spot-on. 

```{python}
from IPython.core.display import HTML

def generate_html():
    return r"""
    <div class="blue-box">
        <p>
    Would you consider investing based on their next tip?
